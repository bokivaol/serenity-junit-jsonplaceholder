# Serenity JUnit Starter project


This is the simplest possible build script setup for Serenity BDD using Java.

You can use this project as a quick starting point for your own projects.

Or simply [download a zip](https://github.com/bokivaol/serenity-junit-jsonplaceholder/archive/master.zip) file.

## Use Gradle on Windows

Open a command window and run:

    gradlew test 

## Viewing the reports

The command provided above will produce a Serenity test report in the `target/site/serenity` directory. Open `index.html` in Chrome and take a look!
